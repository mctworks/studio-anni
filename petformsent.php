            <p class="lead">Your Pet Portrait Request has been sent to Anni! Here's what will happen next:</p>
            <p class='bigserif'>1. Anni will review your request, and determine if she will accept the commission. She
                may e-mail you to the address you've provided for additional information.<br>
                2. Upon approval of your commission request, you will need to pay for the pet portrait before Anni can begin work on it. 
                Anni will e-mail you with the final price (this will include shipping charges) for what she will need to begin work on your pet's portrait.
                <strong>Please remember that once a commission has been paid for, we are not able to offer a refund</strong>, except
                in the case that the piece is damaged or loss during shipment.<br>
                3. After completion of the pet portrait, Anni will contact you with photos of the finished work in 
                addition to shipping details, such as tracking number.<br><br>
                We look forward to speaking with you!<br>- Anni & Mike</p>
